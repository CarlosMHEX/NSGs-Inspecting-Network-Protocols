<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDP, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>Objectives</h2>

- Create VMs (Windows) (Ubuntu/Linux) through Microsoft Azure
- Install Wireshark on windows VM to get a visual representation on the network trafficking going on between VMs
- Inspect traffic of protocols (SSH, RDP, DNS, HTTP/s, ICMP)

<h2>Demonstration</h2>

<p>In this demonstration I show how I setup VMs using Microsoft Azure and installing Wireshark on a VM to inspect the traffic going on in networking protocols, giving a simple explanation of each protocol and how they work.</p>
